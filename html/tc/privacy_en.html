			<h1>MageNerator.net - Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>MageNerator.net takes great care to protect your privacy and to secure
			the data that is stored on the MageNerator.net servers. MageNerator.net employs several
			security professionals who implement the technical and organizational
			security during development and operations. MageNerator.net takes measures to
			protect personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized
			access, unauthorized disclosure, manipulation, or destruction.</p>
			<p>This Privacy Policy describes how MageNerator.net handles the data it
			has access to.</p>

			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p>When you use MageNerator.net, you send pieces of data to MageNerator.net; this
			can be a name, an e-mail address, or information relating to your
			appointment. Other data is generated implicitly by your use of MageNerator.net,
			e.g. log data.</p>
			<p>MageNerator.net is designed to allow you to use the service almost
			anonymously if you wish: You can use MageNerator.net without registration and
			without entering any e-mail address.</p>




			<h2>Log data</h2>
			<p>MageNerator.net records certain requests and transactions in log files.
			This log data is used for troubleshooting, statistics, quality
			assurance, and to monitor system security and can be analyzed to that
			end. MageNerator.net can publish anonymous statistics under the condition that
			no personally identifiable information can be derived from such statistics.</p>

			<p>MageNerator.net also uses Piwik to compile usage statistics.

                Add here more piwik policy

			</p>




			<h2>Cookies</h2>
			<p>When you use MageNerator.net, the service can store cookies on your
			computer. Cookies are little pieces of information that can help
			identify your browser and that can store information, e.g. application
			settings. MageNerator.net uses cookies to track usage, to improve ease-of-use
			and the overall user experience, and to manage advertising
			inventories.</p>


			<h2>Advertising</h2>
			<p>Advertising is one of MageNerator.net’s revenue streams. Therefore,
			MageNerator.net displays advertisements on some of the services, e.g. on
			certain web pages or in e-mails. These advertisements can be targeted
			based on the information that is available to MageNerator.net, e.g. language,
			IP address, poll content, etc. This targeting is always an automated
			process; none of the information used for targeting is analyzed
			manually or made available to advertising customers. In some cases,
			MageNerator.net displays advertisements from Google’s AdSense network. These
			advertisements can be targeted based on the poll content. Google does
			not disclose that information and only uses it for the intended
			purpose. You can review Google’s Privacy Policy here: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/privacy.html</a></p>


			<h2>Outdated and completed polls</h2>
			<p>You can delete outdated or completed (or, in fact, any) polls
			manually at any time using the admin link. When deleting a poll, that
			poll’s information will be deleted from the MageNerator.net databases.
			Furthermore, outdated polls are automatically deleted from time to
			time, but no earlier than 30 days after the last date in the poll, or
			30 days after the last access to a poll without dates.</p>

			<h2>Inactive accounts</h2>
			<p>MageNerator.net can delete user accounts and Premium MageNerator.net accounts if they remain
			inactive (i.e. not accessed) for 1 year or longer.</p>


			<h2>Unauthorized access</h2>
			<p>MageNerator.net implements several mechanisms to prevent unauthorized
			access to polls, accounts, or other data.</p>
			<p>To access a poll, you use the unique link which MageNerator.net provides
			and which contains a random access code. This link is an important
			element to prevent unauthorized access to a poll. You should send this
			link only to authorized people, i.e., the people you wish to
			participate in your poll.</p>
			<p>MageNerator.net accounts are protected by passwords. You should choose a
			secure password and ensure its confidentiality to prevent unauthorized
			access to your account.</p>


			<h2>Inviting from MageNerator.net</h2>

			<p>As an option, you can contact and invite people to participate
			in a poll from MageNerator.net. In this case, MageNerator.net needs to know the e-mail
			addresses of the people to be contacted. You can enter these e-mail
			addresses in the corresponding form. MageNerator.net stores these e-mail
			addresses in your user account (MyMageNerator.net) for your convenience; MageNerator.net
			will be able to offer you the same contacts again next time you use
			the service. You can have MageNerator.net delete all stored e-mail addresses
			any time using the corresponding function in your user account
			(MyMageNerator.net).</p>

			<p>General remark: Like all other personal information, MageNerator.net
			will not share participants' e-mail addresses with third parties.
			MageNerator.net will not send any e-mail communication to participants' e-mail
			addresses without your consent.</p>

			<h2>Contacts integration</h2>

			<p>
			As an alternative (or complement) to the MageNerator.net contacts, you can use your existing
			Google contacts to gain access to the e-mail addresses of the
			people to be contacted. In this case, you authorize MageNerator.net to access
			your Google contacts. Your Google contacts will still be stored
			at Google, while MageNerator.net makes a copy of the e-mail addresses to have efficient access.
			Please note also: The process of accessing your Google contacts is set up (thanks to OAuth)
			to make sure that MageNerator.net at no time has access to your Google
			password. You can delete the e-mail addresses stored at MageNerator.net at any time
			(<a href="/myMageNerator.net/manageAccount.html#calendars">Link -&gt; "Delete all cached contacts"</a>).</p>




			<h2>Plugins</h2>

			<p>MageNerator.net provides optional plugins which extend the service by
			integrating it into your local environment (calendar, contacts).
			A plugin is a software that
			you download and install on your computer, and which has access to
			your calendar and contacts.</p>

			<p>MageNerator.net will use the via plugins accessible information  only for the intended
			purpose. MageNerator.net will only access the information that is necessary to provide
			the intended service.
			</p>



			<h2>Communication between you and MageNerator.net</h2>
			<p>If you send MageNerator.net a message, this message can be stored to
			process it, to compile statistical information, to improve our
			services and support, or to get in touch with you.</p>

			<h2>Payment processing</h2>
			<p>MageNerator.net supports the leading payment processing provider,
			PayPal. You can find their privacy policies here:

			e-mail address to Paypal during a payment process. All this information
			would be requested by the provider anway.
